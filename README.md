Limit concurrency of a function returning a promise.

## Usage

```javascript
var throttle = require("f-throttle")
var throttledFn = throttle(concurrency, anyFn)
```

`throttleFn` functions like `anyFn`, but throttled to a concurrency of `concurrency`, where concurency is a number equal or higher than one.

### Notes

* `throttledFn` returns a promise.
* `anyFn` must return a promise. If it does not, the promise returned by `throttledFn` will be rejected.
* You may pass any number of arguments
* Function context is preserved, so can work for when throttling a function that's a method for an object.
* When you throttle a function to a concurrency of 1, this results in execution in a serial fashion.
